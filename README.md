I enjoy 4clojure.

By solving small problems in broad range of topics, I have a chance to know better about the language.

The interface and test cases are easy to use, I use Emacs a lot so the combination of [4clojure-mode](https://github.com/yveszoundi/4clojure-mode) + `cider-repl`
always make me smile.

This repo is still work-in-progress.
